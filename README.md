# driftwm

A trackpad-first infinite canvas Wayland compositor.

Traditional window managers arrange windows to fit your viewport. driftwm
flips this: windows float on an infinite 2D canvas and you move the viewport
around them. Designed with laptops in mind where trackpad support keeps
getting better and display size is limited. You pan, zoom, and navigate with
trackpad gestures. No workspaces, no tiling — just drift.

Inspired by [vxwm](https://codeberg.org/wh1tepearl/vxwm) and [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri). Built on [smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay).

## How it works

The screen is a viewport onto an infinite 2D plane. Each window has absolute
coordinates on this plane. You move around with trackpad gestures:

- **2-finger scroll** on empty desktop — pan viewport
- **3-finger scroll** anywhere — pan viewport (ignores windows)
- **3-finger double-tap+drag** on a window — move that window
- **`Mod` + 3-finger drag** on a window — resize that window
- **2-finger pinch** on empty desktop — zoom
- **3-finger pinch** anywhere — zoom (ignores windows)
- **4-finger swipe** — jump to the nearest window in that direction
- **4/5-finger pinch** — toggle home position

Mouse: scroll wheel zooms, click-drag pans. `Mod` + click/drag works anywhere.

A static wallpaper gives no feedback when panning an infinite canvas, so
the background scrolls with the viewport. Any GLSL fragment shader works as
an infinitely generated background, or you can tile an image of any size.

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the full specification.

## Status

Early development. Current milestone: **7 — Decorations**.

The compositor runs nested via winit backend, renders xdg-shell clients on an
infinite 2D canvas with viewport panning (scroll, click-drag, keyboard), scroll
momentum with friction decay, GPU-scaled zoom (keyboard and scroll-wheel, with
cursor-anchored zoom and dynamic min-zoom), GLSL shader backgrounds, tiled image
backgrounds, edge auto-pan during window drag, and compositor-rendered xcursor.
Animated camera navigation between windows (directional cone search, MRU cycling,
home toggle). 18 Wayland protocols implemented including DMA-BUF, popups, and
cross-app clipboard.

## Build & run

Requires Rust (edition 2024).

```bash
cargo build
cargo run                         # run nested in existing Wayland session
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run          # with debug logging
```

In another terminal, launch apps inside driftwm:

```bash
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 foot       # or alacritty, ptyxis, etc.
```

The socket name is printed at startup — use that if it differs from `wayland-1`.

## Keybinds

| Shortcut                | Action                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Mod+Return`            | Open terminal                       |
| `Mod+Q`                 | Close window                        |
| `Mod+C`                 | Center focused window               |
| `Mod+Arrow`             | Jump to nearest window in direction |
| `CycleMod+Tab`          | Cycle windows forward (MRU)         |
| `CycleMod+Shift+Tab`    | Cycle windows backward              |
| `Mod+A`                 | Toggle home (0,0) ↔ previous        |
| `Mod+Shift+Left-click`  | Drag to move window                 |
| `Mod+Shift+Right-click` | Drag to resize window               |
| `Mod+Left-click`        | Drag to pan viewport                |
| `Mod+Shift+Arrow`       | Nudge focused window by 20px        |
| `Mod+Ctrl+Arrow`        | Pan viewport by step                |
| `Mod+=`                 | Zoom in                             |
| `Mod+-`                 | Zoom out                            |
| `Mod+0`                 | Reset zoom to 100%                  |
| `Mod+W`                 | Zoom to fit all windows (toggle)    |
| `Mod+Scroll`            | Zoom at cursor                      |

CSD-initiated move/resize (title bar drag, border drag) also works.

More keybinds planned — see [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md#keyboard-shortcuts).
