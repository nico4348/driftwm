# driftwm

A trackpad-first infinite canvas Wayland compositor.

Traditional window managers arrange windows to fit your viewport. driftwm
flips this: windows float on an infinite 2D canvas and you move the viewport
around them. Designed with laptops in mind where trackpad support keeps
getting better and display size is limited. You pan, zoom, and navigate with
trackpad gestures. No workspaces, no tiling — just drift.

Inspired by [vxwm](https://codeberg.org/wh1tepearl/vxwm) and [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri). Built on [smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay).

## How it works

The screen is a viewport onto an infinite 2D plane. Each window has absolute
coordinates on this plane. You move around with trackpad gestures:

- **2-finger pinch** on empty canvas — zoom
- **3-finger swipe** anywhere — pan viewport
- **3-finger doubletap-swipe** on a window — move that window
- **Alt + 3-finger swipe** on a window — resize that window
- **3-finger pinch** anywhere — zoom
- **4-finger swipe** — jump to the nearest window in that direction
- **4-finger pinch in** — zoom-to-fit (overview)
- **4-finger pinch out** — home toggle
- **4-finger hold** — center focused window

**Small trackpad alternative**: hold `Mod` to use 3-finger instead of 4-finger for navigation gestures.

Mouse: trackpad scroll pans, mouse wheel zooms on empty canvas. `Mod` + drag/scroll works anywhere. `Mod+Ctrl` + drag navigates to nearest window.

All gesture and mouse bindings are configurable with context-awareness
(on-window, on-canvas, anywhere). Unbound gestures forward to apps.
See [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml) for the full default set.

A static wallpaper gives no feedback when panning an infinite canvas, so
the background scrolls with the viewport. Any GLSL fragment shader works as
an infinitely generated background, or you can tile an image of any size.

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the full specification.

## Features

Early development — usable as a daily driver on single-monitor setups.

- Infinite 2D canvas with viewport panning, zoom, and scroll momentum
- GPU-scaled zoom with cursor-anchored zoom and dynamic min-zoom
- Window navigation: directional jump (cone search), MRU cycling, home toggle
- Layer shell support (waybar, fuzzel, mako) + foreign toplevel management
- GLSL shader backgrounds or tiled images, scrolling with the viewport
- Configurable trackpad gestures and mouse bindings with context-awareness (on-window/on-canvas/anywhere)
- Runs nested (winit) or on real hardware (udev/DRM with libseat)
- TOML config — all keybindings, mouse bindings, gesture bindings, and input settings are configurable
- Server-side decorations with title bar, shadows, and resize borders for non-CSD apps
- 20+ Wayland protocols: DMA-BUF, popups, clipboard, layer shell, and more

## Build & run

Requires Rust (edition 2024) and these system libraries:

**Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf install libseat-devel libdisplay-info-devel libinput-devel mesa-libgbm-devel
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt install libseat-dev libdisplay-info-dev libinput-dev libudev-dev
```

```bash
cargo build
cargo run                         # run nested in existing Wayland session
cargo run -- --backend udev       # run on real hardware (from TTY)
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run          # with debug logging
```

In another terminal, launch apps inside driftwm:

```bash
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 foot       # or alacritty, ptyxis, etc.
```

The socket name is printed at startup — use that if it differs from `wayland-1`.

## Quick start

`mod` is Super by default (configurable). Essential keybindings:

| Shortcut           | Action          |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| `mod+return`       | Open terminal   |
| `mod+d`            | Open launcher   |
| `mod+q`            | Close window    |
| `mod+ctrl+shift+q` | Quit compositor |
| `mod+scroll`       | Zoom at cursor  |
| `alt+tab`          | Cycle windows   |

All keybindings are configurable. See [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml)
for the full list of defaults, mouse bindings, and settings.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/driftwm/config.toml` (respects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`).

Copy the example, uncomment what you want to change:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/driftwm
cp config.example.toml ~/.config/driftwm/config.toml
```

Missing file uses built-in defaults. Partial configs merge with defaults —
only specify what you want to change. Use `"none"` to unbind a default binding.
